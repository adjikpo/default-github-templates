# Default Github Templates

The contribution guide, issue, and pull request templates are given freely that they might be used in other open source projects.

## Usage

Simply copy the `.github` directory to your project, and edit as required.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute to the templates, but be sure to follow the contribution guide! ;)

## Enjoy

You must enjoy. This is enforced.
